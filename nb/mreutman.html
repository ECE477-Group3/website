    <h3 id="week01">Week 01</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 14, 2014 (2 hour)</b>:<br>Met as a team after class to discuss preliminary project proposal. Refined our initial 
                                                      idea from last semester to a more concrete version. Design is set to have two modes of user
                                                      interface, as set of push buttons and at least one touch screen. Buttons will be utilized
                                                      to play notes where as the touch screen(s) will provide editing of synthesis parameters.</p>

                                                       Ordered development board (TI Tiva C Launchpad) for software and hardware prototyping. 
                                                       The Tiva C series was chosen due to its combined ability to handle control/logic signals 
                                                       while providing powerful DSP functionality. DSP features are also improved by having a 
                                                       dedicated floating point unit, easing the trouble of overflow when performing filtering 
                                                       operations.<br><br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 4th, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>Built, installed, and tested GCC toolchain and GNU code flash tools with Tiva C development kit.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 5th, 2014 (1 hours)</b>:<br>Added documentation to coding with Tiva C. Viewable <a href="../tivac.html">here</a>. This provides 
                                                             help to installing and setting up command line tools for compiling and flashing code to the TIVA C
                                                             development board. Looked into setting up a debug environment, but there appears to be little to no
                                                             documentation available.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 6th, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>Ordered samples of Maxim MAX5216BGUA+ digital to analog converter. This is a 16 bit digital to analog
                                                             converter that operates at a maximum clock frequency of 50MHz. This implies that a 16 bit signal will
                                                             be transmitted at a frequency of 3.125 MHz, a total time of 0.32 micro-seconds which should allow a 
                                                             high sample rate to be utilized when generating audio.<br><br>
                                                             Met with team to brainstorm project ideas and view prior work that team members have done.<br><br> 
                                                             In regards to software development, discussed the polyphony constraints of the synthesizer.
                                                             It would not be possible or wise to allow a user to play an infinite ammount of notes, so it 
                                                             was decided to limit the notes played to eight. The reasoning for this decision was that if 
                                                             the thumbs are utilized as anchors for playing, only eight fingers left for playing notes. 
                                                             This is also comprable/exceeds other synthesizers. For example the Korg Microkorg only has 
                                                             four notes of polyphony.<br><br> 
                                                             A initial diagram for the software was drawn up providing an early framework of the note 
                                                             generation scheme. The diagram can be viewed in the picture below.<br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 10, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>Attempted to set up Code Composer Studio under a Linux environment in order to utilize its 
                                                        debugging capabilities. Decision to make use of Code Composer Studio was also motivated by 
                                                        discovering that it can be utilized for free as long as either the Tiva C development board 
                                                        is utilized or the XDS100 JTAG programmer is used. Unfortunately, there appears to be multiple 
                                                        issues when running under Linux. Was able to compile the code, but not flash or debug the code.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 11, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>Discussed packaging constraints for our project with the rest of our team. Ran through multiple 
                                                        designs and provided critical review ehen needed.<br><br>
                                                        Also recieved help from Kyle for setting up Eclipse under Linux. Was able to successfully compile, 
                                                        flash, and debug code on the Tiva C development board.<br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 12, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>Met with the team during the mandatory lab session and began to finalize the packaging constraints.
                                                        Further work is going to be required to size the PCB in order to meet the size dimensions allowable 
                                                        under the coarse funding.<br><br>
                                                        Began looking at the Tiva C reference documents for the peripherals required for this project. For the 
                                                        audio microcontroller, my portion of the project, it was decided to utilize SPI to transmit control 
                                                        parameters and note information from the other microcontroller dedicated to handling user input. In 
                                                        addition, SPI will be utilized to send information to the external digital to analog converter. Other
                                                        peripherals to be utilized include the uDMA module, providing direct memory access channels for nonblocking
                                                        data transmision from the SPI communications, and the Floating Point Unit for DSP routines. A initial
